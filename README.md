# photo-manager

## INTRODUCTION

One of the biggest problem faced by me is to organize photos that are scattered across devices, hard drives and folders. I was looking for solutions/applications to this problem. I found few meeting requirement partially and needling lot of consolidation work as pre-requisites before it can work. Another problem is everytime you get back from a vacation or function or event, you have another set of photos that are again pile-up to unordered set. There are cloud solutions available like Facebook, Google Photos, etc. but no such solution available for locally stored photos.

Consider a situation where you are discussing a memory with your friends and they ask you to share it ! OMG, it will take ages to locate photos corresponding to that memory. If I have this problem then it is very much likely that others will be also facing same problem.

The objective of this project is to develop web application that will address these issues.
